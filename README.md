# Social Network API

This project is an API for a social network web application. It provides the necessary functionality for users to share their thoughts, and manage their friend list. The API utilizes a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB, to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently. The Mongoose ODM is used for defining and interacting with the database models.

In addition to the code implementation, I have created a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the API and shows how it meets all the acceptance criteria mentioned above. Please refer to the video for a detailed overview of the project.
